Description:

The objective of this challenge is to build a timed quiz application on Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores so that one can guage their 
progress compared to their peers.

This application was challenging because it involved the use of a lot of new javascript concepts like using local storage, 'set Attribute, query Selectors, stringify and also the use of a timer.

I got some guidance from our instructor and the teaching assistants in providing some clarity on how to build this application.

Even though it was challenging, I was motivated to build this application by trying to put some of the javascript concepts that I had learned, to practise.
