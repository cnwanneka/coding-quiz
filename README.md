# coding-quiz

Description:

The objective of this challenge is to build a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz application on Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores so that one can guage 

their progress compared to their peers. This quiz keeps track of high scores and quiz-takers' initials.

This application was challenging and made use of a lot of javascript concepts like using local storage, set Attribute, query Selectors, stringify and also the use of a timer.

I got some guidance from our instructor and the teaching assistants in providing some clarity on how to build this application.

Even though it was challenging, I was motivated to build this application by trying to put some of the javascript concepts that I had learned to practise.

The URL of the application is https://cnwanneka.github.io/coding-quiz/
